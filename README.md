# AmazingOctopusesBattle
AmazingOctopusesBattle is a two-player pixel art video game designed for shared keyboard gameplay, inspired by Duck Game. It was developed using Unity version 2020.3.7f1 and C#.

## Project Structure
The project is structured in a typical Unity game format, with directories organized by asset types and subtypes, including prefabs, audio, scripts, animations, UI, particles, sprites, and more. It employs various design patterns and techniques such as dependency injection, inheritance, singleton, and custom data structures designed to transfer data between screens and classes.

## Gameplay
The objective of the game is to eliminate the octopus controlled by the other player. Players have access to various movements and an arsenal of weapons scattered across the map.

Similar to Duck Game, the gameplay involves eliminating the opponent using any means necessary. The player who remains standing wins the round and moves to a new map where the battle restarts.

## How to Play | Movements
You can move both palyers with one keyboard.

The octopuses have the ability to double jump. You can stick to walls and move vertically while doing so. Additionally, weapons will be thrown once they run out of ammunition, briefly disabling the opposing player when hitting.
